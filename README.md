# QBO-Metrics
Code to calculate metrics of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation

Contains two files, one with all the routines (Analysis-routines.py) 
and the second one where data is read in (analyse_qbo_metrics.py).

Input: field of zonal mean zonal wind and zonal mean temperature on
latitude-pressure level-time grid.

Output: QBO metrics as defined in
